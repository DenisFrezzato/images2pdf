# Images to PDF book
This is a script that creates a PDF document from images, optimising them for your device. The script trims and resizes each image based on your device viewport. Do you have a device that doesn't support `*.cbr` or `*.cbz` files and do you like to read mangas? This can be useful for you.

## Installation

```bash
npm i -g images-to-pdf-book
```

## Usage
Usage example:
```bash

```
